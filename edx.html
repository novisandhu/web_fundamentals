    <p><q>He who draws noble delights from sentiments of poetry is a true poet, though he has never written a line in all his life.</q>- George Sand</p><hr>

    <p>the word earth means <blockquote>the planet on which we live; the world.</blockquote> or <blockquote>the substance of the land surface; soil.</blockquote></p><hr>
