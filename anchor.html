      Children play around a lake and are amazed to see the water joining in
      their fun. Soon, through their dance and song, a flower is created from
      the water of the lake. However, their merriment disturbs the devas - gods
      of the elements - who are celebrating a victory over the demons. The
      children’s seemingly feeble flower is in danger of being destroyed by the
      wrath of the gods. The innocence and hope of children is pitted against
      the powers and ego of the devas. As events unfold, discover whether the
      flower survives. Learn the secret of Sahaj Anand – innate, spontaneous
      bliss. This story is adapted from the Kena Upanishad, one of the many
      treasures of knowledge and wisdom from the Vedic era.
